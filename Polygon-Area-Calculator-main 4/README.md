# 🟧 Polygon Area Calculator  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Polygon Area Calculator** is an interactive Java applet that allows users to dynamically modify a square into any valid **3-sided (triangle) or 4-sided (quadrilateral) polygon**. Users can drag and reposition vertex points to reshape the polygon, and the applet will automatically compute and display the following:  

✅ **Polygon Area**  
✅ **Angle Measurements**  
✅ **Side Lengths**  

## 🔧 Features  
- 🎯 **Drag & Drop Interface** – Easily modify the shape by moving vertex points  
- 📐 **Real-Time Calculations** – Instantly updates area, angles, and side lengths  
- 🔄 **Flexible Shape Transformation** – Convert a square into a **triangle** or **quadrilateral** dynamically  
- 🖥️ **Java-Based Implementation** – Built using **Java Applets** for interactive visualization  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Start with a **square** as the base shape  
2. Click and **drag any vertex** to change its position  
3. The applet **automatically recalculates** the area, angles, and side lengths in real-time  
4. Continue adjusting the shape as needed  

## 📂 Technologies Used  
- **Java Applets** (Swing/AWT)  
- **Geometry Calculations** (Using trigonometry and coordinate geometry)  

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Add **support for polygons with more than 4 sides**  
🔹 Improve **UI design and interactivity**  
🔹 Convert Java Applet to a **modern JavaFX or web-based version**

⚡ **Fun Fact:** Did you know? The formula for a polygon’s area varies depending on its shape, but for any irregular polygon, the **Shoelace Theorem** provides a simple way to compute it using vertex coordinates! 🎯
